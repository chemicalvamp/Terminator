# Terminator
A Swiss Army Knife of apps, Don't play indie games without it.<br>
<br>
It's features:<br>
  -Will play an almost inaudible sound periodically to keep your soundbar on and usable. (Because auto power off is really something they needed..)
  -It has 2 hotkeys: 
    -ctrl+alt+Ins will kill whatever window is topmost. (Because sometimes task manager is not accessible, behind a crashed app that refuses to give up the screen.) <- this is my favorite thing to do
    -ctrl+alt+Home will minimize whatever window is topmost. (Because sometimes even perfectly running fullscreen apps refuse to comply with how a window should work.)
  -App Denial will periodically check running processes and kill any process matching a line in Denials.txt
  -On starting it will run every line in Commands.txt and append to Output.txt
  -It is a system tray app, with right click context menue to use or disable features:
    -"Kill" the next app you click on.
    -"Minimize" the next app you click on.
    -"Show" you the Process ID of the next app you click on.
