# Terminator
A Swiss Army Knife of apps, Don't play indie games without it.<br>
<br>
It's features:<br>
  -Will play an almost inaudible sound periodically to keep your soundbar on and usable. (Because auto power off is really something they needed..)<br>
  -It has 2 hotkeys: <br>
    -ctrl+alt+Ins will kill whatever window is topmost. (Because sometimes task manager is not accessible, behind a crashed app that refuses to give up the screen.) <- this is my favorite thing to do<br>
    -ctrl+alt+Home will minimize whatever window is topmost. (Because sometimes even perfectly running fullscreen apps refuse to comply with how a window should work.)<br>
  -App Denial will periodically check running processes and kill any process matching a line in Denials.txt<br>
  -On starting it will run every line in Commands.txt and append to Output.txt<br>
  -It is a system tray app, with right click context menue to use or disable features:<br>
    -"Kill" the next app you click on.<br>
    -"Minimize" the next app you click on.<br>
    -"Show" you the Process ID of the next app you click on.<br>
